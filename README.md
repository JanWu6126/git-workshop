## Configure Git
When you use Git in a team, it will be important to keep track of who changed which files.  It’s good practice to configure Git with your name and e-mail address when you first install it.
1.	Open a Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Command Prompt (Windows).
2.	Type:  git config --global user.name "Your name"
3.	Type:  git config --global user.email "Your e-mail address"
